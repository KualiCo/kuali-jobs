# [Kuali's recruitment website](https://jobs.kuali.co)

## Installation

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for templating and running locally. It's pretty easy to get up and running. Reach out to the Ops team for assistance.

## Tech used

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for templating, Sass, and other features
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) for CSS resets and other goodies
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for their lovely font, Roboto
- [Google Web Fonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) for hosting Roboto locally instead of relying on Google's servers
- [Rellax JS](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/) for parallax effects
