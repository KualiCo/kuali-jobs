        <p>Sadly though, between bureaucracy, inflated egos, and lack of autonomy, most jobs suck. We get it. We hire great people and let them do what we hired them for. Crazy, right? Well, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kuali-Reviews-E1156448.htm">our Glassdoor reviews</a> say it all. Come to Kuali and you’ll love it as much as we do.</p>

    <h2>LOL “culture,” amirite?</h2>
    <p>So many companies talk about culture in terms of foosball, snacks, and parties. Sure, we have that stuff too, but to us, it’s not what makes a great employee experience. We live and die by our <a href="#values">cultural values</a>. And we value autonomy above all else. We like to hire amazing people and get the h*ck out of their way.</p>
    <p>Real culture is the kind that makes you proud of what you do and who you do it with.</p>

    <h2>Kuali cultural values</h2>
    <p>Kuali has 6 official cultural values and an extra unofficial one. We talk about these all the time. They’re connected to our peer bonuses and they’re used to set the bar for how we treat each other. And they work. They’re not just some lame manifesto collecting virtual “cyber” space dust.</p>
